Contributors to qadsl are welcome, but please follow the below
guide lines. Specifically the section on patches.


Working with qadsl
==================

The qadsl daemon is divided into logical blocks:

etc/
lib/
  conf/
  html/
src/

http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain_toc.html


The qadsl coding style
======================

Make yourself familiar with the GNU coding standards (shipped with
most GNU/Linux systems as the standards.info file), then read the
Linux kernel coding standards and ignore Linus' jokes.  Then look at
the Gtk+ header files to get aquainted on how to write nice header
files that are almost self documenting. 

Uses spaces instead of tabs and set Emacs to use gnu indentation
style, "C-c .2 is the shortkey.

TODO: add emacs style file headers -*-C-*- plus magic of setting
      up the rest correctly (spaces for tabs and GNU style).

qadsl is prepared for gtk-doc function header comment parsing. Please
follow that style of coding.

Example:

   /**
    * function_name - Short description
    * @variable_1: Description.
    * @variable_2: Description.
    * @variable_3: Description.
    * @variable_4: Description.
    *
    * Empty line, then function description with references to
    * input variables like @variable_1 or other functions(), 
    * %CONSTANTS and more. See the gtk-doc specification written
    * origianlly by Miguel de Icaza. 
    *
    * New subsections are started like this:
    *
    * Subsection: yada yada
    *
    * Finish off with the output/generated data.
    *
    * Returns: -1 for all errors.
    *           0 when OK.
    */

For all other multi-line comments use

   /* text
    * is written
    * like
    * this.
    */


Submitting patches
==================

Patches are preferrably submitted against the latest CVS head
revision of the file(s) in question:

# cvs diff -u -r HEAD filename > patch-qadsl-file-brief-description.diff

Otherwise the following always applies:

# ls 
qadsl-orig qadsl

# diff -ruN qadsl-orig qadsl >patch-qadsl-brief-description.diff

If the .diff is a bit on the large side it can be gzipped,
or bzip2:ed. But for small diffs that is not recommended.

# gzip -9 patch-qadsl-brief-description.diff
