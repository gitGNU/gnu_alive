HACKING Alive                                                -*- org -*-

This file is both a guide for newcomers and a todo list for oldstayers.
It lives in the repo but is not included in the distribution.

* next

* ongoing (some of which may go into the next release)
  (grep "git grep -n -H -E -e '(FIXME|TODO):'")
  see also [[bug-alive:][bug-alive (mailing list archive)]]

* portability
  |-----------+------+-------+-----|

* bootstrap tools
*** usual GNU stuff: Autoconf, Automake
*** GNU Guile (see [[portability]] above)
*** [[http://www.gnuvola.org/software/guile-baux/][Guile-BAUX]]
*** [[http://www.gnuvola.org/software/snuggle/][SNUGGLE]]

* coding standards: generally [[info:standards][GNU]]
*** indent with emacs (don't like the result? fix emacs!)
*** (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
*** (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
*** everything UTF-8, [[http://www.utf8everywhere.org/][please]]
*** ChangeLog
***** ttn-style: TITLE LF LF {BLURB LF LF}* BODY
***** exclude titles suffixed "; nfc." (no functional change)

* copyright update policy
*** individual files only on change
*** individual years

* repo branch discipline
*** no ‘master’ -- do not panic!
*** archive
    This branch is for what was already released.  It will never be rebased.
    Its tip will always have a commit title starting with "Release".
*** p -- "perhaps", "probably"
    This branch is where largely-stable changes intended for the next release
    live.  It's very unlikely to undergo rebase, but not entirely impossible.
    (Since GNU Alive is not so popular, we don't bother announcing it.)
