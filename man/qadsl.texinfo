@cindex overview

GNU @command{qadsl} produces the familiar, UNIX traditional, complete
lack of output when everything works.

It allows nonprogrammers to use a classic computer science tool which
would otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by the
GNU General Public License, users are free to share and change it.

GNU @command{qadsl} was written by Joachim Nilsson. Its predecessor,
qadsl was written by Jakob Stasilowicz.
