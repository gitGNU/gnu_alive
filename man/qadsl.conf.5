.SH NAME
qadsl.conf \- qadsl configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqadsl.conf\fP is usually found in /etc/qadsl.conf and contains
username, password and login server information for your Internet
connection.

.SH SYNTAX
The qadsl.conf syntax is extremely free form. So if you have ever
peeked into a UNIX configuration file before, you should be right
at home, you should not even have to read any further ...

For those of you who hate configuration files, or never have seen
one before, you should proceed directly to the examples section.

For most of the time you only need to supply a USERNAME, PASSWORD
and LOGIN_SERVER. Like this:

USERNAME     = u1234567
.br
PASSWORD     = pwd12345
.br
LOGIN_SERVER = valo1.tiscali.se

However, most of the time the LOGIN_SERVER setting should be given
as a pure IP address, like this:

LOGIN_SERVER = 10.0.0.6

This because the name of the login server sometimes is not listed
in the name server (DNS) of your ISP. The number 10.0.0.6 is the
default for all Orbyte Wireless System installations.

.SH EXAMPLES
# Username
.br
USERNAME     = u1234567

# Password
.br
PASSWORD     = pwd12345

# Login Server, DNS name or IP number
.br
# Tiscali      valo1.tiscali.se
.br
# Telia        login1.telia.com
.br
# COMHEM       ????
.br
SERVER       = 10.0.0.6

# Start daemon [YES/NO]?
.br
START_DAEMON = YES

# Daemon type [LOGIN/PING]?
.br
DEAMON_TYPE  = LOGIN

# Daemon delay in minutes.
.br
INTERVAL     = 20
