	GNU Alive is a keep-alive program for internet connections.
	It repeatedly pings a series of user-specified hosts, thereby
	encouraging (one hopes) the involved networks to not disappear.

	GNU Alive is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
	modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
	published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3, or
	(at your option) any later version.


Requirements
============

	GNU Guile (any version)
	ping(1) that accepts ‘-n -c COUNT’


Installation
============

	Before starting, make sure GNU Guile (any version) is installed.

	See file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.
