	GNU Alive is a keep-alive program for internet connections.
	It repeatedly pings a series of user-specified hosts, thereby
	encouraging (one hopes) the involved networks to not disappear.

	GNU Alive is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
	modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
	published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3, or
	(at your option) any later version.


Requirements
============

	GNU Guile (any version)
	ping(1) that accepts ‘-n -c COUNT’


Installation
============

	See file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.
	In short:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

	Successful installation includes:
	  $(bindir)/alive           -- the program
	  $(infodir)/alive.info     -- documentation


Troubleshooting
===============

	Please send bug reports to <bug-alive@gnu.org>.
