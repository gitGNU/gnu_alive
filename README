GNU Alive - An auto-login & keep-alive program for Internet connections
========================================================================

* Introduction

GNU Alive is an auto-login & keep-alive daemon for Internet connections.
Previously known as qadsl it was created to automate the annoying login
process of several Swedish ISP's, e.g., Telia ADSL, COMHEM and Tiscali.
All of which use the Orbyte Wireless System, a login/DHCP server from
Swedish company ServiceFactory AB -- see <http://www.servicefactory.se>
for more info.

If our dear Internet Service Providers, ISPs, could keep better tabs on
their ports vs. their subscribers then this program would be obsolete.
Would we all not be a lot happier to simply pay for our Internet
connection and be online as long as our NIC and the ISP's switch have a
linkup?

Comments are welcome.
