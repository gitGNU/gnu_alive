Template: alive/use_debconf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
Description: Let Debian handle /etc/alive.conf?
 Do you want Debian to handle the Alive configuration file?
 .
 Answer yes and Debian will ask all necessary questions and setup
 the file /etc/alive.conf for you.  All your answers will be
 remembered for future upgrades, so you will not be bugged again.
 .
 Answer no to this question to handle /etc/alive.conf yourself.
 Please note that GNU Alive will not be started automatically
 if you answer no.


Template: alive/reuse_qadsl_conf_values
Type: boolean
Description: Reuse settings from old qadsl.conf in alive.conf?
 A configuration file from a previous installation was found
 in /etc/qadsl.conf.  Would you like to reuse the settings in
 alive.conf or configure a new one?
 .
 Recently qadsl was renamed GNU Alive and as such it is completely
 backwards compatible.  If your old settings file is correct then
 it is safe to answer yes here.
 .
 Please note, however, that this installation program does not
 take old local dotfiles, i.e. ~/.qadslrc, into account.  The
 program itself though does, but to avoid any future confusion
 it is strongly suggested that you rename that file ~/.aliverc
 or create a new one.
 .
 The config file search order for GNU Alive is:
   1. Any file given on the command line.
   2. ~/.aliverc
   3. ~/.qadslrc
   4. /etc/alive.conf
   5. /etc/qadsl.conf
 .
 Answer yes to let reuse old qadsl.conf settings in alive.conf.
 Answer no to create a new /etc/alive.conf with Debconf.

Template: alive/template_installed
Type: note
Description: An alive.conf template installed!
 A template configuration file has been installed in /etc/alive.conf.
 .
 Please edit it to suit your needs and then enable the daemon by also
 editing the init script, /etc/init.d/alive.
 .
 As is customary for these kinds of installations the daemon is
 disabled by default so no unintended communication to the outside
 world is attempted.

Template: alive/login_server
Type: string
Default: 10.0.0.1
Description: Enter login server name or IP number
 Please input here the login server name or IP number.
 .
 In most cases the default IP number is sufficient, and in 
 any case you should have received this information from
 your ISP, Internet Service Provider, along with your
 username and password.

Template: alive/username
Type: string
Description: Enter your login- or username
 Please input your designated username.
 .
 This is information you must have from your ISP.  You cannot
 access the login server without it.

Template: alive/password
Type: password
Description: Enter your password
 Please input your password.  It will not be displayed
 in clear text here, but might be sent in clear text over
 the Internet, depending on the server configuration.
 .
 This information might have been sent separately from the rest
 of your login information, or it was all on the same piece of
 paper from your ISP.  You can probably not access the login
 server without it.
 .
 If you are converting from an old qadsl.conf file simply press
 enter here.  The password is also converted but not displayed
 here.

Template: alive/done
Type: note
Description: All done - /etc/alive.conf created!
 A generic configuration file has been created based on your
 input.  The file has been set up to match a generic login server 
 and may not work for you.  Therefore we suggest that you take
 it for a "test drive" before you enable the automatic start
 of the daemon.
 .
 For help with debugging your particular setup and with all the
 different configuration options, see the man pages alive(8),
 alive.conf(5) and the info document.
 .
 When you are confident that your setup works you can go ahead
 and enable the daemon in /etc/init.d/alive.
