alive (1.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjust runlevel settings. Don't start in rc[235].d/S20alive, instead
  start in rcS.d/S42alive right when networking and firewalls have started.
  Keep rc[016].d/S75alive, only adjust to 75.
  * It should be noted that 1.4.0-2 also changed the behaviour of stop a
  bit.  Now we only exit the daemon, we do *not* log out.  This could in
  a limited way be potentially harmful since the INET connection would be
  up at reboot before firewalls have started ... see README.Debian for more.

  transition from qadsl-->alive without a hitch. Converting global config
  files on the fly.
