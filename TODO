* TODO List - Items listed in falling priority order - first most important

* lib/conf/parser.y: Add YYERROR when conf_set() fails!
Must not continue to read conf file on error.

* Memory leaks ... 
libconf does a lot of strdup() into the parms array. It then puts
pointers to statics into some values (setup default values). Instead
these statics should also be strdup'ed and freed at end of
program/daemon! 

* Add Debian patches and integrate them with existing patches
drom the FreeBSD ports collection.

* Be more stubborn when login fails ... 
Don't exit(1) at every possible juncture.
Redo/cleanup the netfunc code some more.

* Add some intelligent way of "probing" for the login server.
I.e., add a list of known login servers perhaps?
Tiscali used to redirect all non-logged in requests through
a port to the login server. That could've been used in this
probe scheme ...

* Read all we need from the first login page, e.g., /sd/login.
It contains username= and password= phrases in the <input>
statements. All we need to build correct HTTP messages is
available at the ... of the ISP.

The most perfect way to limit the amount of configuration
data the user has to enter would be to only select the ISP
and enter username & password. Or enter the IP# or login
server name instead of the ISP name.

This is basically a very simplified HTML parser that only
looks for and parses <input ...> statements. Should be 
easy enough to implement.

* Always search for XXX for bisarre spots that need attention.
This is btw the preferred way to indicate stuff like this to others...

* I18N support.

* Add support for getopt_long() and strndup()
If they don't exist on the platform. Put these things in lib/ and
make them be checked for by configure.

* Configure checks for sysconf and friends. Look at Zsh.
