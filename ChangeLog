2004-03-04  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* debian/control (Description): Bogus format of description fixed.

2004-03-03  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* include/settings.h.in: Add features.h to list of headers to look
	for, we need it.

	* include/config.h: Add features.h it defines a lot of stuff we
	really need to eliminate stupid missing declarations from standard
	include files.

	* configure.in: Bump version again, 1.3.3
	Add features.h to list of headers to look for, we need it.

	* debian/changelog: Prepare for next release, 1.3.3.
	
	* debian/control (Description): Synchronized with .rpm package.

	* qadsl.spec.in (%decription): Synchronized with .deb package.

	* src/lock.c: Update copyright and cleanup function comment.

	* src/config.c: Add copyrights and licensing.

	* src/process.c: Add copyrights and licensing. And cleanup the
	"logged in" semantics according to new scheme.

	* src/main.c: Update copyright and email.

	(main): Stupid misplaced else ...

	(main): Implement HAVE_RINDEX

	* lib/conf/conf.c: Add copyrights and licensing.

	* lib/conf/parser.y: Add copyrights and licensing.

	* lib/conf/tokens.l: Add copyrights and licensing.

	* src/log.c (write_log): Need to increase size of static log
	buffer. Also, add copyrights and licensing.

	* include/http.h (http_open_server): No longer global function,
	thus removed from this file.

	(PRELOGIN_MSG): Cleanup and use HTTP 0.9
	(LOGIN_MSG): Cleanup and use HTTP 0.9

	* src/daemon.c: Update copyright and email addresses. 

	(daemon_thread): All connections should be closed by the handlers

	stupid. Also, cleanup of "already logged in?" semantics.

	* src/http.c: Add copyright and licensing. Also, overhauled the
	file in search for missing close() calls. A heads up from the
	Mandrake RPM maintainer, Oden Eriksson <oden!eriksson()kvikkjokk!net>.

	lot of clean up of the semantics plus useful documentation. :-)

2004-02-22  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* lib/getopt.c: New functionality that adds GNU getopt() and 
	getopt_long() support for platforms that do not have it. 

	* lib/getopt1.c: dito.

	* include/getopt.h: dito.
	
	* include/daemon.h (daemon_kill): Add verbsity to prototype.

	* include/log.h: Define log types.

	* lib/conf/parser.y (conf_set): Use log() macro instead of fprintf().

	* lib/conf/tokens.l: Cleanup.

	* lib/conf/conf.c (conf_read_file): We only need read permission
	to evaluate the .conf file.  Also, make sure to check if we succeed
	in opening it, otherwise the parser will not have anything to read
	from and hang forever waiting for input from a truncated stdin.

	* src/daemon.c (daemon_thread): Let the verbosity level from the
	client propagate to the daemon and increase the verbosity of the
	latter in the logfile.

	* src/http.c (http_log_login): Keep track of when we are no longer
	logged in so that we can take note of all state changes in the logfile.

	* src/lock.c (lock_read): Truncate already existing pid file and
	make sure it is world readable, the PID is not secret.

	* src/main.c (main): Add long option support and update usage()
	function. Exit on NOP operations with a usage() printout.
	Swap meanings of -v and -V to verbose and version, respectively.
	To be more like the majority of the other GNU tools.

	* src/process.c (process): Let verbosity propagate to dameon and
	report result from SIGHUP sent to an already running daemon.

2004-02-20  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* lib/conf/conf.c (conf_read_file): Does not work with yacc,
	revert while we wait for libconf to become reentrant. 
	(conf_set_value): dito.

	* lib/conf/parser.y (conf_set): dito.

2004-02-18  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* src/http.c: Cleaned up namespace mess. All functions now have
	the http_ prefix. 

	* include/http.h: dito.

	* src/process.c (process): Updated to match new namepace of http.c
	
	* src/daemon.c (daemon_thread): dito.


2004-02-17  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* etc/qadsl.conf (INTERVAL): Reduce default sleep interval
	from 20 to 5 to alleviate against buggy login servers.

	* src/config.c: Reduce default sleep interval between logins to
	reduce possible long periods of being disconnected.

	* src/process.c (process): Call kill() directly instead of
	unecessary wrapper functions.

	* configure.in: Up version number after todays 1.3.2 release,
	new intermediate version is 1.3.3-pre1.

	* src/daemon.c (daemon_kill): Remove stupid wrapper fn.

	* include/config.h: Beginnings of support for HP-UX.

	* lib/conf/conf.c (conf_read_file): Try using older method of
	redirectng stdin to make qadsl build properly on, at least,
	NetBSD. Idea from redirect.c on snippets.org.

	* configure.in: We want strcasecmp() if not found we use our
	replacement from -lost.

	Check for existance of c99 or gnu99 flags to compiler iff
	compiler==GCC. Also, remove default -O2 that autoconf insists on
	putting in there.

	* lib/Makefile.am (libost_a_SOURCES): New library for stuff not
	on the current platform, lost. Hence the name -lost.

	* lib/strcasecmp.c (strcasecmp): New file, imported from fetchmail-6.2.4.

2004-02-16  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* configure.in: Bump verion number.

	* lib/conf/parser.y (log): Add neat log functionality that can be
	turned on with -DDEBUG, --enable-debug.

	* src/config.c (config_load): Don't continue if conf_read_file() fails.

	* lib/conf/tokens.l: Clean up mess when values inside "". 

	(log): Add neat log functionality that can be turned on with
	-DDEBUG, --enable-debug.

	Also, fix missing stuff for "lexer in lexer" while parsing values
	included in ""'s.

	* lib/conf/conf.c (strlndup): Don't overwrite last character of
	string with NUL. Also, make sure we don't try to copy NULL strings.
	
	(conf_set_value): len decremented too much. Make sure to check
	for sane values of len before decrementing it. Also, we cannot
	free value if value has been tampered with, so we save value in
	orig_value and free it instead.

	(conf_read_file): Remove unnecessary yyin, using stdin instead. 
	Plus minor formatting cleanups.


2004-02-10  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* lib/conf/conf.c: Add unistd.h, dup() needs it.

	* lib/conf/parser.y: Temporarily revert to non-reentrant yylineno
	behaviour to be able to build on cygwin.

2004-02-09  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* lib/conf/conf.c (strlndup): Renamed copy_string() to strlndup().

	(strlncpy): New (still unused) function to replace dangerous strcpy().

2004-01-31  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* qadsl.spec.in: Update.

	* qadsl.lsm.in: Update.

	* src/config.c: Update aliases of parameter list and re-add
	"NULL"-termination of list, libconf needed it to not traverse
	into infinity.

	* lib/conf/conf.c (conf_find_key): Fix major bug where a
	parameter_list could be traversed into infinity w/o finding the
	end of the list, even when the list was terminated.

	* lib/conf/conf.c: First effort at making libconf reentrant.

	* lib/conf/parser.y: dito

	* lib/conf/tokens.lo: dito

	* etc/qadsl.conf: Cleanup to comply with specifications in
	src/config.c. Also, fix email address.

2004-01-20  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* src/daemon.c (daemon_thread): Major cleanups.

	Make sure we exit the daemon if we cannot create any lockfile - this
	to prevent multiple daemons starting up.

	Check if we're already logged in after pre_login() stage, then we do
	not need to call log_login().

	* src/main.c (main): Fix bogus comment.

	* src/config.c: LOGIN_STRING_HEADER default to NULL instead of "".

	fallback_pid_files[] temporarily stored here. Need a better
	place, not in lock.c though - it is supposed to be agnostic of
	the file name.

	* src/http.c (internet_login): login_string_header might be NULL,
	do not call strlen() with NULL.

	Do not compose a login string of empty parts it might generate
	very bisarre strings, e.g., "?one=1&&three=3&four=4".

	Bogus if() statement checked the wrong pointer, temp instead of
	login_string. 

	Skip url_encode() for now.

	Zero-terminate the read message from the server, needed for
	parsing later to determine if login was successful or not.

	Just return, leave avalutation of result to caller.

	(log_login): Skip internet_login() if pre_login() reveals that
	we're already logged in.
	
	* src/http.c (url_encode): strchr(unsave, s[i]) should suffice as
	the filter to find characters that must be encoded. Otherwise too
	much is encoded and the resulting string is too long and might
	not be possible to parse for the server.

	* src/process.c (process): Cleanup. Everything now done in the
	same switch-case, it might be better. However, fns like
	process_login() and process_logout() might be even better.

	lock_read() and lock_remove() should use whatever main() found
	out and stored in config->pid_file instead of PID_FILE!

	* src/lock.c (lock_create): Added fallback_pid_files[] and minor
	cleanups. The function will alter the @file argument if a
	fallback is used instead of the given one.

	(lock_read): dito. A return value >0 is an OK pid.

2004-01-14  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* debian: Added Debian package directory.

2004-01-11  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* .: Cleanups and final tests for release 1.3.0
	  This release will be the first with the new
	  code base - to be followed by continous new
	  features.

2003-07-06  Joachim Nilsson  <joachim.nilsson@member.fsf.org>

	* qadsl: initial version.
