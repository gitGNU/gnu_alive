Small config file parser                                           qADSL
========================================================================

Introduction

		A small .conf file parser combined with some homebrewed
		"database" functions.

Description

		This directory contains a small but very competent LALR
		based config file parser. Its grammar is simple and fits
		well with todays "common look" of configuration files.
		
		Example:

			# This is a .conf file
			#
			# <--- Comment char, like Bourne shell

			# Empty lines are ignored like white space.

			# A parameter and its argument
			PARAM = VALUE

			# Another parameter ...
			set PARAM VALUE

			# And another ...
			PARAM VALUE

			# Case does not matter ...
			PaRaM = VaLuE

		There are of course hazards in these configuration files.
		Questions like: "Where does the value begin and the name
		of the parameter end?". The answer is simple, it is up
		to the constructor of the config file format to see to
		it that no ambiguities exist.

		Bad example:

			# Config file for XXX
			#
			#  Description of XXX and its config file

			# Erroneous paramater name. Value becomes "name value".
			Parameter name value
			Set Parameter name value
