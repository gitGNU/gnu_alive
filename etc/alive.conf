########### User specific configuration parameters ######################
#
# As a regular user of any of the supported Internet Service Providers,
# ISPs, you only need to modify the username, password and login server
# options below. However, you might want to tune some of the other neat
# parameters below. If so, take a look at the alive.conf(8) man page for
# details, otherwise the below short descriptions might be sufficient.
# There are also some example configurations available at the following
# location: /usr/share/doc/alive/
#

# Username, e.g., u1234567
USERNAME     = 

# Password, e.g., pwd12345
PASSWORD     = 

# Login Server, DNS name or IP number, often 10.0.0.6 or 192.168.2.1
# Tiscali      valo1.tiscali.se
# Telia        login1.telia.com
# COMHEM       login1.comhem.se

########### Server type specific configuration parameters ###############
#
# Several types of login servers exist on the market. This program was
# initially written to login to Telia and COMHEM servers based on
# Orbyte Wireless System from Swedish company ServiceFactory AB --
# see <http://www.servicefactory.se> for more info.
#
# Their product can best be identified by the login URL and sometimes
# also the IP number (10.0.0.6).
#
# As it happens, Tiscali broadband and ADSL service use the same system.
