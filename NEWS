* v1.3.2 to v1.3.3

** Bugfix: config.c

The actual login part of the daemon was never run even if it was
activated in the configuration file.  Bad use of strcasecmp() led
to that part of the config file to be interpreted in the straight
opposite of the setting.

** Documentation updated

At least the TeXinfo documentation has been updated.

** --long-options implemented
To support long options getopt_long() and getopt() has been made
a part of the qadsl source tree.  This because long options are
not available on all platforms, at least not NetBSD.

** -v now is verbose, and -V is version
To more adhere to the style of GNU command line options the
short options for verbose and version, -V and -v respectively,
have been switched.  We apologise for the confusion this might
create.

** Vastly improved logging (/var/log/daemon.log in Debian)
All calls to syslog() have been made more informative and clear.  Now
they actually denote "SUCCESSFUL" and "FAILED" to mark the login
status.  Also, when given -V (--verbose) that switch now propagates
properly to the daemon.

To swamp the logfiles even further another switch has been added, 
--debug, that replaces the need to rebuild from source using
--enable-debug to configure.  This switch adds a ridiculous amount of
data to the logfiles and will improve the way people can debug their
connection setups.

Also, all state changes are now noticed by the daemon in the logfile.

** Forced relogin on already running daemon
As suggested by Oden Eriksson <oden!eriksson()kvikkjokk!net> qadsl
now sends SIGHUP to an already started deamon when the client is
started with --login. This forces the daemon to cancel its current
delay and relogin. 

Forced relogins are noted explicitly in the logfile.

** Cleaned up http.c
The name-space in http.c has been updated even further from the old
code.  It has been changed to http_server_init(), http_server_login()
etc.

Alot of the code has also seen face lifts and general simplificaions
and some long overdue documentation.

** Socket leak fix
Mandrake RPM maintainer, Oden Eriksson <oden!eriksson()kvikkjokk!net>,
reported too many open sockets from a long running qadsl process.
Turned out to be a socket leak that occurred when bailing out early
on error detection.


* v1.3.1 to v1.3.2

** Ugly bug in .conf file parser
A really ugly bug in the .conf file parser made it impossible
to parse the new style .conf file format.

** Supported architectures
The list of supported arhitectures and dsitributions has grown.
qadsl-1.3.2 has been tested on:

	    Slackware 9.1 (intel)
	    Mandrake 9.2 (intel)
	    Debian GNU/Linux (intel/Sarge)
	    Debian GNU/Hurd (intel/Sid)
	    NetBSD 1.6 (intel)
	    FreeBSD 5.1 (alpha)

* v1.3.0 to v1.3.1

** "make dist" actually builds a proper distribution.
The last source release 1.3.0 did not build, due to various files
being missing from the distribution. 

** NetBSD fixes
All qadsl releases from 1.3.1 onwards should now build properly on
NetBSD.  Courtesy of jakov.

** GNU/Hurd fixes
All qadsl releases from 1.3.1 onwards should now build properly on
GNU/Hurd.  Thanks to Gürkan Sengün <gurkan()linuks!mine!nu> for
providing a testing machine, http://hurd.she.kicks-ass.org:8084/

* v1.2.1 to v1.3.0

** Major rewrite of most of the code 
Most of the code has been restructured and rewritten to simplify the
next big step - extension - qadsl is going places.

** .conf file parser in CFG
Bison and Flex has been called upon to do their magic on the .conf 
file format.  This has enabled a much more free and extensible file
format.

** http handling improved
State management has been improved to be more fault tolerant.  As well
as also being cleaned up immensely.

This means more stability, no more sudden logouts just because your
ISP temporarily disabled logins.  We now patiently wait for the login
server (or your network card or whatever) to be reactivated.

** Debian patches included
Just like we have a qadsl.spec file (for .rpm's) we also include the
Debian scripts to build .deb files.

Mostly done, needs testing by others.  /Joachim 2004-01-20

** Failover lock file support
If PID_FILE does not exist or cannot be opened for reading/writing
we need to find out other ways to play.  

Mostly done, needs testing.  /Joachim 2004-01-20

** More stubborn when login fails ... 
qadsl does not exit(1) at every possible juncture anymore.

Mostly done.  /Joachim 2004-01-20
