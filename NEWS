* v1.2.1 to v1.3.0

** Major rewrite of most of the code 
Most of the code has been restructured and rewritten to simplify the
next big step - extension - qadsl is going places.

** .conf file parser in CFG
Bison and Flex has been called upon to do their magic on the .conf 
file format. This has enabled a much more free and extensible file
format.

** http handling improved
State management has been improved to be more fault tolerant. As well
as also being cleaned up immensely.
