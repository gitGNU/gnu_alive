* v1.3.1 to v1.3.2

** Ugly bug in .conf file parser
A really ugly bug in the .conf file parser made it impossible
to parse the new style format.

** Supported architectures
The list of supported arhitectures and dsitributions has grown.
qadsl-1.3.2 has been tested on:

	    Slackware 9.1 (intel)
	    Mandrake 9.2 (intel)
	    Debian GNU/Linux (intel/Sarge)
	    Debian GNU/Hurd (intel/Sid)
	    NetBSD 1.6 (intel)
	    FreeBSD 5.1 (alpha)

* v1.3.0 to v1.3.1

** "make dist" actually builds a proper distribution.
The last source release 1.3.0 did not build, due to various files
being missing from the distribution. 

** NetBSD fixes
All qadsl releases from 1.3.1 onwards should now build properly on
NetBSD. Courtesy of jakov.

** GNU/Hurd fixes
All qadsl releases from 1.3.1 onwards should now build properly on
GNU/Hurd. Thanks to Gürkan Sengün <gurkan()linuks!mine!nu> for
providing a testing machine, http://hurd.she.kicks-ass.org:8084/

* v1.2.1 to v1.3.0

** Major rewrite of most of the code 
Most of the code has been restructured and rewritten to simplify the
next big step - extension - qadsl is going places.

** .conf file parser in CFG
Bison and Flex has been called upon to do their magic on the .conf 
file format. This has enabled a much more free and extensible file
format.

** http handling improved
State management has been improved to be more fault tolerant. As well
as also being cleaned up immensely.

This means more stability, no more sudden logouts just because your
